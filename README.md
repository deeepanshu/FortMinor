## Issue: cant populate second level of data.
### API- /populate/3, file: ./routes/category/index.js
 

 - Heirarchy: Category -> SubCategory -> Product
 - In category, I am storing all the ids of subcategories, same goes with subcategories(ids of products), but when I fetch categories I want objects instead of ids.
 - I am able to get Category and SubCategory together, and SubCategory and Product together
 - Getting them together is, I am getting objects instead of _ids, I want this happen for levels.
 - Through this API, I want all 3 together.
