## Issue: cant populate second level of data.
### API- /populate/3, file: ./routes/category/index.js
 
 - Heirarchy: Category -> SubCategory -> Product
 - I am able to get Category and SubCategory together, and SubCategory and Product together
 - Getting them together is, i am getting objects instead of _ids, i want this happen for levels.
 - Through this API, i want all 3 together.
